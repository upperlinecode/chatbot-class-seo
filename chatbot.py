######## BEFORE YOU START ###########

## Decide a theme / personality for your chatbot.

## Decide what sort of questions you are going to ask your user. What information will you be gathering?

### VERSION 1: Ask the user's name and greet the User.







######## IDEATION TIME ###########

## 1. Designate a scribe for your pair. Throw out as many ideas as you possibly can -- aim for at least 10!


## 2. Narrow down to your top 2 ideas


## 3. Share out your top 2 ideas with the group.


######## PAIR PROGRAMMING PROTOCOL ###########
## 1. Decide who is driving and who is navigating

## 2. Driver, click on "invite" and copy-paste the link to to your breakout room chat

## 3. Navigator, open up the repl.it link, but DO NOT TYPE.

## 4. Driver, share your screen. It will be your job to type exactly what the navigator is telling you to type. Your job as a team will be to solve the challenges below using the string methods we've been learning about.

## 5. Once you've solved one small challenge, switch driver navigator roles.
